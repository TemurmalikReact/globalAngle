Project description
We came up with the UI/UX design and development of Flashtract, a B2B that specializes in Construction Billing Automation Software. With a mission of making the processing of construction payments easier and faster, Flashtract needed a website that would help their potential customers understand the benefits of their software, allow them to demo the product, and gain access to the answers to their questions through content or contacting the company.
